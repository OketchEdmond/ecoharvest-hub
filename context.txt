EcoHarvest Hub is a Nairobi-based startup founded by Edmond Oketch. We connect local farmers with consumers through the CropConnect App, offering real-time market data, weather updates, and sustainable farming tips via the Agri-Insights Dashboard. Our mission is to reduce food waste, support farmers, and ensure communities access fresh, affordable, locally sourced food.
